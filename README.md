# timeLapseCamera

This is a arduino project.  To work properly as-is, you need to connect a display (here I use a cheapo nokia screen) and a relay (low level triggered) that is connected to your camera's shutter switch.  If this is confusing to anyone, ask away and I will try to clarify.

#2 arduino connections are as follows

pins 12 - 8 are connected to the nokia display (cheapo off aliexpress)

pins 7-0 are connected to the keypad (cheapo off aliexpress)

pin A0 is connected to the low level triggered relay, which is connected to the cameras shutter pin.  (yes I cracked open a cheap camera and soldered wires onto the buttons pads)
